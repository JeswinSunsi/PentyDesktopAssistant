Penty is a Desktop Assistant programmed with JS and Python for its backend and HTML and CSS as its front. It has some cool in-built features, like an emailer, link shortener, and a quick-open browser. The main highlight is that it can fetch simple answers from the web, such as the temperature, birthdates, and other quick answers, and display them in a visually pleasing window. It uses a Python module named Eel to connect the backend to the GUI (https://github.com/samuelhwilliams/Eel/)

## Prerequisites 

### Modules
Until you package Penty into an executable, you will have to manually import a lot of modules. The easiest way to do this is with PIP.

You can install this from requirements.txt

### Others
This App currently only runs on a Windows platform (7 - 10)

You will need a google app password for the mailer. (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

If you need the added functionality of WolframAlpha, you'll have to get a free API Key (https://products.wolframalpha.com/simple-api/documentation/)

## Searchbar commands
Apart from answering simple questions, the search bar can also be used to perform some quick actions when certain commands are typed out. All the commands work in both upper and lowercases.

## Packaging Pent
Packaging Pent into a distributable .Exe is pretty straightforward. Pip install pyinstaller if you dont already have it. Then, delete the mail_creds.txt from the web folder.
Navigate to the src directory where the web folder and App.py file is kept, through your terminal. Then, run 

```python -m eel app.py web --onefile```

You can use most valid pyinstaller flags except --noconsole. A workaround for this has already been added into app.py.
Your distributable file will be stored at src/dist. Move this to a new folder. Inside the folder, create a text document named mail_creds.txt and type in 1 and 2 on the first and second lines of the text file respectively. Also, to avoid having to open a folder then a file to run the program, you can make a shortcut to app.exe and leave it somewhere outside the main folder.
